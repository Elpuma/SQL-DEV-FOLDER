Select all of the below that are true.

    A **LEFT JOIN** and **RIGHT JOIN** do the same thing if we change the tables that are in the **FROM** and **JOIN** statements.
    A **LEFT JOIN** will **at least** return all the rows that are in an **INNER JOIN**.
    **JOIN** and **INNER JOIN** are the same.
    A **LEFT OUTER JOIN** is the same as **LEFT JOIN**.

Above are two small tables for you to test your knowledge of JOINs. You can click on the image to get a better view.
    Country has 6 rows and 2 columns:
    countryid and countryName
    State has 6 rows and 3 columns:
    stateid, countryid, and stateName
    Use the above tables to determine the solution to the following questions.
    State.countryid             The foreign key that would be used in JOINING the tables
    State.stateName             -
    Country.countryName         -
    State.stateid               The primary key of the STATE table
    Country.countryid           The primary key of the COUNTRY table

The above two tables are given again just for minimizing scrolling. If you were to perform the following query:
SELECT c.countryid, c.countryName, s.stateName
FROM Country c
JOIN State s
ON c.countryid = s.countryid;

Match the results of the query to the description.
