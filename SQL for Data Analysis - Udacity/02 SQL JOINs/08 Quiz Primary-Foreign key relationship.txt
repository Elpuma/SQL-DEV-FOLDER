    Definition or Column Description                            Term or Column

    account_id                                                  A foreign key that exists in both the web_events and orders tables                                 
    ON accounts.account_id = web_events.id                      -
    ON accounts.id = web_events.id                              -
    Primary Key                                                 has a unique value for every row in that column. There is one in every table
    ON web_events.account_id = accounts.id                      The ON statement associated with a JOIN of the web_events and accounts tables
    ON web_events.id = accounts.id                              -
    Foreign Key                                                 the link to the primary key that exists in another table
    id                                                          The primary key present in every table of our example database


Select all that are true for primary keys.
    There is one and only one of these columns in every table.
    They are a column in a table.

Select all that are true of foreign keys.
    They are always linked to a primary key.
    In the above database, every foreign key is associated with the crow-foot notation, which suggests it can appear multiple times in the column of a table.
